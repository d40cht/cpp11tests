/*
    Memory ordering:
    
    (afaik, these affect in-thread re-ordering as a result of optimisations - and how the consequent writes are visible to other threads).
    
    - memory_order_relaxed 	Relaxed ordering: there are no synchronization or ordering constraints, only atomicity is required of this operation.
    
    - memory_order_consume 	A load operation with this memory order performs a consume operation on the affected memory location: prior writes to data-dependent memory locations made by the thread that did a release operation become visible to this thread.
    
    - memory_order_acquire 	A load operation with this memory order performs the acquire operation on the affected memory location: prior writes made to other memory locations by the thread that did the release become visible in this thread.
    
    - memory_order_release 	A store operation with this memory order performs the release operation: prior writes to other memory locations become visible to the threads that do a consume or an acquire on the same location.
    
    - memory_order_acq_rel 	A load operation with this memory order performs the acquire operation on the affected memory location and a store operation with this memory order performs the release operation.
    
    - memory_order_seq_cst 	Same as memory_order_acq_rel, and a single total order exists in which all threads observe all modifications (see below)
